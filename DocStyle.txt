THIS IS THE STYLE YOU WANT TO FOLLOW WHEN WRITING COMMENTS
There should be three lines of comments preceding the declaration of the function or component.
The first line begins "DOC" and is followed immediately by either "Component: " or "Function: " depending on which it is.
This is then followed by a description overview of what the item is, and what it does.
The next line begins "Input: " and is followed by a list of the names items that are passed in as input, separated by commas. Put "None" if none. Add " (optional)" if an item isn't required.
The line after begins "Output: " and is followed by what is returned.
For components, this is a "JSXElement".
For functions, it's the data-type of the returned item

For all data-types, we'll be using Java naming conventions, so String, char, int, etc.

An example for components (those things that return JSX HTML elements that get rendered):
//DOC: Component: This component renders a single course button in the sidebar that, when clicked, changes the main panel to display that course.
//Input: name, active, changeActiveCourse
//Output: JSXElement
function CourseListItem(props) {

An example for functions (input and output logic):
//DOC: Function: This function takes Converts the class code passed into the function into the actual English name of the course
//Input: classcode
//Output: String
function codeToName(classcode) {

To use this documentation generator, paste the contents of index.js into input.txt, and run Main.java. The output is README.md.
